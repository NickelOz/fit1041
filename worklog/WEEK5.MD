# Week 5

This week was spent largely experimenting with the Arduino kit.

This included using RFID-embedded cards, and components that vary in resistance based on certain inputs, such as pressure-based sensors and photoresistors. The pressure based sensors could prove interesting, as while capacitive touch points can be used for touch input, it only has two states (touched/untouched). This can be solved with a workaround by adding double-tap or hold inputs, but it does not feel intuitive. Using these pressure gauges would allow for soft and hard presses, or squeezing, which would also prevent unintended input.

Some of the systems I implemented can be found at the bottom of this post.

1. RFID-embedded cards with a reader connected to the Arduino

2. A force sensor with a sound unit. The harder you press, the higher the pitch!

3. A photoresistor with the sound unit. It can be played like aÂ Theremin. By moving your hand and changing the amount of light it receives, you can raise and lower the pitch.

4. Just for fun, a little piano!
