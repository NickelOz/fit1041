# Week 3

This week was focused around exploring a variety of area and possible topics to research, and then trying to narrow it down to a more focused area.

I considered exploring how music could be made more accessible, as I am a musician myself. Possible ideas for this could be designing easier methods to quickly read sheet music, or simplifying common instruments so that they could be played without need for visual reference (think of extracting the bumps on the F and K keys of a keyboard used for touch typing, and applying them to a piano). 

Matt suggested that technologies such as an Xbox Kinect could be used to track how people solve problems without the use of sight, mapping the motion of their hands and how they examine new/unfamiliar objects. My idea was that this could be examined with small puzzles, working to understand the role touch played in problem solving, when sight could not be used. Upon further discussion, we concluded that while this would be an interesting area, it would be very hard to create problems to test, as low vision people often require a large amount of context about an object before they interact with it.

In the end while I havenâ€™t quite decided what area to focus on, though I will likely be exploring possible methods to make 3D models more communicable. For example, the heart from last week already provides a likeness of a muscle, due to its flexibility, but incorporating a small unit that vibrates and emits sound make it possible to simulate a heartbeat. Instead of listening to an informative monologue, the haptic and auditory feedback from the model itself would be much more engaging for blind students. In the coming weeks I hope to draft and design a variety of methods to communicate greater information about objects beyond their raw shape, and later attempt to implement them.
