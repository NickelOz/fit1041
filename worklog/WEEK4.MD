# Week 4

This week was largely spent preparing the project specification. I should hopefully be able to upload a copy in the near future.

Matt recommended a recent paper he had worked on, and that served as my primary context source. A full copy can be found [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07294360.2016.1177001), if you would like to browse it. 

After that was finished, I had a little bit of an experiment with an Arduino, performing basic IO with capacitive touch points. I'll be experimenting with this over the coming weeks to decide whether I should include this in my solution.

I think investigating the use of RFID tags could prove interesting, as attaching them to an object would allow for proximity-based interaction, compared to something more precision based, like capacitive touch points or scanning a QR code to obtain information.
