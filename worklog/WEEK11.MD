# Week 11

After resoldering some of the amplifier pins on the shield, audio was finally emitted! This meant that the full setup could finally be tested, and lo and behold the different audio bites played correctly for each triggered touch point. This means that all that is left to be done with this prototype is to finish placing the touch points onto a map and affixing everything to a stable base for presentation.

Outside of this, there was also some draft work done on my report, as well as developing a poster and talk with Andrew.
