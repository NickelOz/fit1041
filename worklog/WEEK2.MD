# Week 2

I was assigned to investigate how interfaces, models and other physical technologies could be used to make the world more accessible for people with low vision and complete blindness. This area interests me because it offers the opportunity to experiment with new technologies, as well as the possibility of being able to making a positive impact on the world for those with visual impairments.

I met with Matt on Friday to tour the SensiLab and get a taste of the available technology that I might be able to use.

For modelling, there were a variety of 3D printers and laser cutters. A variety of plastics could also be used as well for construction. While most objects were printed with harder, lightweight plastics, there was also a model human heart with a more flexible plastic. This was an example of how new materials could be used to extend the capabilities of 3D printing, going beyond recreating object in detail and shape, and being able to give those with blindness the feeling of how a heart compresses and expands when they squeeze it in their hand.

Other models used capacitive touch sensors to provide interaction with 3D maps, with each sensor being connected to a conductive board and set to play sound clips. These touch points could provide audio cues to help users navigate mapped buildings and environments, or provide additional information about landmarks and waypoints.

In the coming weeks, I hope to investigate how these modelling and interactive technologies can be used to further enable those with blindness to perceive, interact and navigate the world around them.
