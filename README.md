# FIT1041

Designing tangible interfaces for the low vision community.

All code used in prototyping can be found in the [touch_map](https://github.com/NickelOz/fit1041/tree/master/touch_map) directory.

## Requirements

The [WaveHC](https://github.com/adafruit/WaveHC) library, courtesy of Adafruit. Needed to interface with the Arduino Wave Shield

An Arduino with at least an ATmega328 chip

Minor soldering skills

## Built using

 - An Arduino Uno
 - A multiplexer, in this case Sparkfun's 8channel breakout board ([ID #74HC4051](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13906))
 - Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), in this case Adafruit's 3/4in FSRs ([ID #166](https://www.adafruit.com/product/166))
 - An Arduino-friendly audio shield, in this case Adafruit's Wave Shield ([ID #94](https://www.adafruit.com/product/94))
 - A lot of wiring and 10Kohm resistors
